## Overview

Was asked by my friend Claudia to help her update her existing website as I am currently studying Code First Girls Introduction to Web Dev and have recently gotten accepted into their Degree for Full-Stack.

<br>

## My process

I had to rethink the structure of the website as well as adapt the existing content to a new format. 
I decided on providing a landing page and the different parts such as about & contact on different pages so as not to crowd the landing page.

I started with a few wireframes in Adobe XD that I later translated into code.

<br>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

<br>

- Adobe XD

<br>

### What I learned

I learned how to put in the carousel properly with bootstrap as well as adapting the navbar to how I wanted it to look.
Used CSS grid to help with the layout/design. 

<br>

### Continued development

The form took some fiddling to get right and even now might need to get fixed so the message actually sends, so that will be fixed ASAP.
Anything else that Claudia might want to add will be added accordingly.
